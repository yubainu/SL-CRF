# ONTOS: Offline Scientific Manuscript Integrity Checker

## Verification of Logical Consistency in Scientific Manuscripts via Structural Invariants

---

## 1. Purpose

This Proof of Concept (PoC) investigates whether  
**logical leaps**, **data fabrication (hallucination)**, and **contextual contradictions**  
in scientific manuscripts can be detected **structurally** in a completely **offline environment**.

ONTOS is defined as a **Structural Logic Validator**.

Unlike conventional writing-support tools (e.g., grammar or style checkers),  
ONTOS does **not** evaluate surface-level correctness.  
Instead, it measures the **mathematical and structural sanity of logical flow**  
during the text processing phase of a language model.

## 2. Hypotheses

### H1: Fabrication Detection  
When a manuscript contains **non-factual numerical data** or **contextually irrelevant conclusions**,  
the **Structural Inconsistency Index (IDI)** observed during processing will increase significantly  
compared to fact-based, logically coherent descriptions.

### H2: Contextual Consistency  
When the **Abstract** and **Conclusion** of a manuscript are processed sequentially,  
a logically consistent paper will yield an ONTOS profile characterized by:

- Low Mean IDI
- Low Variance (Standard Deviation)

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Input Signal

- Manuscript text is processed using a **local Small Language Model**
  (e.g., Llama-3-8B or equivalent).
- During inference, ONTOS observes **internal structural signals**, including:
  - Attention behavior
  - Energy-flow–derived instability metrics (IDI)

All processing is performed **offline**.

---

### 3.2 Verification Datasets (Intentional Degradation)

To evaluate sensitivity to logical integrity, three dataset variants are used:

- **Original**  
  High-quality, peer-reviewed papers with well-established logical structure.

- **Corrupted (Logical Jump)**  
  Manuscripts where paragraphs or explanatory steps are intentionally removed  
  to introduce structural gaps.

- **Fabricated**  
  Manuscripts containing *plausible but false* data or conclusions generated by AI.

---

## 4. Implementation: Structural Integrity Map

ONTOS computes IDI values for each sentence or paragraph, producing a  
**Structural Integrity Map (Logic Heatmap)** for the entire manuscript.

| Color | Interpretation |
|------|----------------|
| Green | Structurally stable; logic is consistently supported |
| Yellow | Structural volatility; potential logical gaps or insufficient explanation |
| Red | Structural collapse; high probability of fabrication or contradiction |

---

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

- **Detection Accuracy (DA)**  
  Probability that ONTOS correctly identifies intentionally introduced:
  - Logical jumps
  - Fabricated data

- **Inference Speed (Offline)**  
  Time required to scan a ~10-page manuscript on consumer hardware  
  (e.g., MacBook-class CPU).  
  **Target:** < 30 seconds

---

## 6. Strategic Value

### For AI Safety & Research Communities

- **Privacy-First Architecture**  
  Unpublished manuscripts never leave the local environment, eliminating
  intellectual property leakage risks.

- **Mechanistic Transparency**  
  ONTOS visualizes structural signals that are normally invisible to human reviewers,
  indicating whether a sentence is processed with internal consistency.

- **Automated Peer Review Support**  
  Functions as an auxiliary *AI referee*, reducing reviewer burden and
  proactively detecting potential academic misconduct.

---

## 7. Success Criteria

The PoC is considered successful if:

- ONTOS can distinguish **Original** vs **Fabricated** manuscripts
- Using **IDI variance metrics**
- With statistical significance: **p < 0.01**

## Notes

- This repository represents an **experimental research prototype**.
- It is not intended as a finalized product or production system.
- Design choices prioritize **structural insight** over benchmark optimization.
